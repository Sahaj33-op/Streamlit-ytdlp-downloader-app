## 🔐 Data Handling Policy

- User-uploaded files (e.g., `cookies.txt`) are **stored temporarily** and removed **immediately after use**.
- The app does **not store, log, or transmit any personal or cookie data** beyond the current Streamlit session.
- All source code is [public and auditable](https://github.com/Sahaj33-op/Streamlit-ytdlp-downloader-app).

> 🔎 If you're concerned, you are encouraged to run the app **locally** for full data control.

## ✅ Best Practices

- Never upload cookies from sensitive/personal accounts unless you trust the host.
- Use throwaway/alternate accounts for testing or accessing age-restricted/region-locked content.
- Always inspect the code before uploading any personal files.
