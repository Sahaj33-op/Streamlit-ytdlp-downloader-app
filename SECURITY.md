## 🔐 Data Handling Policy

- User-uploaded files (e.g., `cookies.txt`) are **stored temporarily** and removed **immediately after use**.
- The app does **not store, log, or transmit any personal or cookie data** beyond the current Streamlit session.
- All source code is [public and auditable](https://github.com/Sahaj33-op/Streamlit-ytdlp-downloader-app).

> 🔎 If you're concerned, you are encouraged to run the app **locally** for full data control.

## ✅ Best Practices

- Never upload cookies from sensitive/personal accounts unless you trust the host.
- Use throwaway/alternate accounts for testing or accessing age-restricted/region-locked content.
- Always inspect the code before uploading any personal files.

## 🇪🇺 GDPR & Data Protection Compliance

This project does **not collect**, **store**, or **process** personal data.

However, if you choose to upload files like `cookies.txt`, these **may contain session data** that can be considered personally identifiable information (PII) under laws like:

- EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- UK Data Protection Act
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

**Recommendations:**
- Only upload data you control and understand.
- Never upload cookies from accounts containing personal, sensitive, or financial access.
- Prefer running the app locally to retain full control over your environment.
